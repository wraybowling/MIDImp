# Security Policy
MIDImp is software that can connect to other devices within your local network. The messages sent are over the UDP protocol and as such there is much less security for better and for worse. Messages will arrive faster, but there's no guarantee that they will arrive at all.

## Supported Versions

Basically, my "policy" is, if it's not 1.0 yet, I don't "support" it.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |
| 1.0.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
